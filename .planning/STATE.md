- Single v0.8.0 milestone for all 29 audit findings (H8 deferred to v0.9.0)
- Phase by subsystem: BLE → Sync → Lifecycle/Security → iOS → Validation
- H6 (sync push transaction) included despite cross-repo scope
- Guided + Deep Analysis workflow (plan approval + thorough analysis for BLE/sync)
- 3 plans per phase: blockers, high severity, medium/cleanup

### Phase 32: BLE Reliability
**Goal**: Fix the BLE connection chain so devices can connect, reconnect, and maintain stable sessions
**Requirements**: BLE-01, BLE-02, BLE-03, BLE-04, BLE-05, BLE-06, BLE-07, BLE-08
**Recommended Agents**: Senior Developer, Mobile App Builder, Evidence Collector
**Success Criteria**:

- Scan stops after timeout period (H4 fix verified)
- Permission denial shows appropriate action button per Android version (H10 fix verified)
- No uncaught exceptions from BLE collectors or init flows
**Plans**: 3

### Phase 33: Sync & Data Integrity

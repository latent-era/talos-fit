### v0.7.0 MVP Cloud Sync (Phases 29-31)

**Branch:** `MVP` — https://github.com/9thLevelSoftware/Project-Phoenix-MP/tree/MVP
**Scope:** Mobile-only. Portal planned separately in phoenix-portal repo.
**Source:** `.planning/exploration-mvp-cloud-sync.md`, `docs/plans/mvp-cloud-sync-mobile.md`

- [x] Phase 29: Core Sync UI (2/2 plans) — Enable sync UI on both platforms, ProGuard fix (completed 2026-03-15)
- [x] Phase 30: iOS Sync Launch (2/2 plans) — Credential injection, Darwin engine verification, TestFlight (completed 2026-03-15)
- [x] Phase 31: Polish & Validation (4/4 plans) — UX cleanup, sync discoverability, version bump, E2E validation (completed 2026-03-15)

### Phase 29: Core Sync UI
**Goal**: Enable the user-facing sync experience that's been built but commented out since v0.6.0
**Requirements**: SYNC-UI-01, SYNC-UI-02
**Recommended Agents**: Senior Developer, Frontend Developer
**Success Criteria**:
- LinkAccount route is navigable from Settings → "Link Portal Account"
- LinkAccountScreen shows login/signup/sync controls
- Release build (Android) does not crash on sync due to ProGuard stripping
- Debug build compiles cleanly on both Android and iOS
**Plans**: 2

### Phase 30: iOS Sync Launch
**Goal**: Make cloud sync functional on iOS by injecting Supabase credentials and verifying the Ktor Darwin HTTP engine
**Requirements**: SYNC-IOS-01, SYNC-IOS-02, SYNC-IOS-03
**Recommended Agents**: Mobile App Builder, Senior Developer
**Success Criteria**:
- PlatformModule.ios.kt reads SupabaseConfig from Info.plist (not hardcoded)
- iOS app can authenticate with Supabase GoTrue (login + signup)
- iOS app can push a workout session and pull routines via Edge Functions
- TestFlight build uploaded and accessible to beta testers
**Plans**: 2

### Phase 31: Polish & Validation
**Goal**: Add sync status visibility, bump version, build releases for both platforms, and validate end-to-end sync
**Requirements**: SYNC-POLISH-01, SYNC-POLISH-02, SYNC-POLISH-03
**Recommended Agents**: Senior Developer, Frontend Developer, Evidence Collector
**Success Criteria**:
- Sync error indicator visible in SettingsTab when hasPersistentError is true
- versionName = "0.7.0", versionCode incremented
- Signed release APK/AAB builds successfully
- TestFlight build submitted
- E2E test: sign up on portal → sign in on mobile → complete workout → sync → verify data on portal dashboard
**Plans**: 3
